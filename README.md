# SequencePlayer
 Try tapping the Thue-Morse sequence for a high score! Begin by choosing either the left or right side, then follow the thue-morse sequence from there.

## TODO:
### UX:
 * Arrows on each pad for legibility
 * Make power milestones more obvious (eg unique colors)
 * Make the actual sequence more obvious (some cool thue-morse animation?)
* add a restart button
 * add a quit button
### Code:
 * more and better comments
 * improve sound responsiveness
 * clean up the mess that is indicator.py
 * add resize support
